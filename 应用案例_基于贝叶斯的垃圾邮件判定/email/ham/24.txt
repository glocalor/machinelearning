Facebook hasn’t been this cheap since the beginning of the pandemic.

After plunging 14% for the week to close at $146.29, shares of Facebook parent Meta are at their lowest point since March 2020, and for a period on Friday, they had sunk even lower. Meta has lost 61% of its value over the past 12 months, by far the biggest slide among Big Tech stocks and more than double the drop in the Nasdaq Composite.

In sliding for five straight days, Meta is now trading just 28 cents above its closing price on March 16, 2020, when the early days of Covid-19 sent U.S. stocks reeling.

If Meta falls below $146.01, it will be the lowest since January 2019. That’s when Facebook was dealing with the aftermath of the Cambridge Analytica Scandal that tested consumer confidence in the social media company and led to a series of heated congressional hearings.
