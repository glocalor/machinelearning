London’s police force has described the ceremony as the biggest security operation it has ever undertaken.

Some 500 guests representing nearly 200 countries and territories will be attending — presidents, prime ministers, kings, queens and sultans among their number — and huge crowds are expected to throng the streets.

Britain has not held a state funeral on the scale planned for the queen since that for World War Two leader Winston Churchill.

The government said big screens to watch the ceremony would be set up in Hyde Park in London and in cities across the country. The funeral will also be aired live by three broadcasters.

Television ratings service Overnights.TV estimated that across the BBC and other channels carrying news, some 33 million people in Britain had tuned in on the day of her death.
