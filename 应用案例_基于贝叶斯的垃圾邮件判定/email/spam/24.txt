That dream is still accompanied by harsh realities: Covid-19 restrictions have made park traffic unpredictable, and almost every guest in the yurt needs a tutorial on living off the grid, Herron says.

“I definitely would like to upscale, but I only want to grow this vision on a sustainable level,” he says. “I have neighbors who have four, five or six Airbnbs on their property, and I see the stress it brings — and how the quality of care starts to fall through the cracks.”

For Herron, upscaling means installing plumbing, building more yurts and buying more land. He says he finds that expansion process bittersweet.

“I’m a reserved, conservative person, and I like to keep things simple and small and sustainable,” he says. “Given the opportunity, I’ll definitely capitalize and I’d love to see more yurts out here. It’s just a matter of having time and money to invest.”
