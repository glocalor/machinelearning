The rental directly feeds into Herron’s small touring business, The Desert Hiking Company: Guests can book Grand Canyon hikes at discounted rates. The company earns Herron up to $40,000 per year, but it’s deeply reliant on customer tips — which means the yurt is a perfect way to sustain his income and desert lifestyle, he says.

“It’s been a dream come true to host people on the land, then wake up early with them and show them the canyon, and take them on a hike,” Herron says. “To give them a whole packaged experience that’s led by a local who’s passionate about the area.”
