The first time Herron stayed in a yurt, at a ski resort outside Flagstaff, he recognized the circular structure’s “unique energy.” He mimicked that yurt’s skylight when he built his own, so renters can see the stars.

Building the yurt involved more manual labor than Herron expected. He bought the materials off a website in 2020 for $8,000, then spent nine days and $4,000 building a wooden platform for it. Then, he spent another $3,000 to reinforce the structure: Because of Flagstaff’s powerful wind gusts, he wanted the yurt to withstand winds up to 200 miles per hour.

The yurt doesn’t have plumbing. Neither do Herron’s two homes on the property. Herron says he keeps a constant eye on his water supply, so he and his guests can drink water, wash dishes, shower and use the toilet on site.
