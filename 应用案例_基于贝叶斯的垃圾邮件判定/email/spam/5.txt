Speaking to CNBC in Mandarin, Guo said that she was laid off twice in less than a year, something she described as “quite incredulous.” 

She was first retrenched in July last year, while working at a private company providing after-school education. Guo was laid off when China cracked down on the education system and implemented the “double reduction” policy, which aimed to ease the burden of excessive off-campus tutoring for students. 

After traveling for half a year around China using her severance package, Guo returned home to Shenzhen and found a job at a real estate company in February this year.
