China’s stability-obsessed Communist Party, which is next month likely to give Xi a third leadership term and cement his place as the country’s most powerful leader since Mao Zedong, has in the past warned against so-called “color revolutions”.

Xi stayed away from a dinner attended by 11 heads of state in line with his delegation’s Covid-19 policy, a source in the Uzbek government told Reuters on Friday.
