“The world has entered a new period of turbulent change, we must grasp the trend of the times, strengthen solidarity and cooperation, and promote the construction of a closer community of destiny with the Shanghai Cooperation Organization,” Xi said.

“We should support each other’s efforts to safeguard security and development interests, prevent external forces from staging color revolutions, and jointly oppose interference in the internal affairs of other countries under any pretext.”

Xi criticized “zero-sum games and bloc politics,” a veiled reference to the United States which Beijing has criticized in the past for leaning on allies to counter China’s spectacular rise to the status of a superpower in waiting.

Putin has repeatedly said that the United States is plotting so-called “color revolutions” similar to those which swept established elites from power in places such as Ukraine.
