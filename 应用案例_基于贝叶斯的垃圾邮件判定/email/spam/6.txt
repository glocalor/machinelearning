Much to her horror, her entire department was laid off shortly after. 

“I was definitely affected… The job market situation this year has been quite dire. When I tried to find another job, it was during the time when the tech industry was also reporting layoffs,” Guo said. 

“I was looking for a job fervently, but I couldn’t find one that was suitable.” 

Lying flat became a form of “escape from reality” for Guo, she said. After failing to secure another job, she used her free time to take up part-time jobs to cover her daily expenses, or pursue other hobbies.
