For Guo, who turned 30 this year, societal expectations that one should have the ability to own a home, and boast of a good job and family, are felt most when she compares herself to her peers. 

“There is that expectation to have a house, a good career and a family — of which I have none.” 

But the concept of lying flat, or not having a full-time job in her case, has given her time to think about what she values in life, Guo said.
