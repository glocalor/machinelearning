Lying flat and letting it rot are the antithesis to the definition of success in China — which can be captured with the expression “cheng jia li ye,” said Miao. “That means, being able to buy an apartment, have a family, a decent career and money.” 

However, it is not just the shaky job market that has made these aspirations increasingly out of reach for some people, no matter how hard they work.

For example, purchasing a home in large cities like Shanghai and Beijing has become “nearly impossible” for the average young Chinese, said Miao.

According to Zhuge, a real estate market monitoring and research institute in China, the country’s housing price-to-income ratio is “much higher” than the international average of 3 to 6 times.

In 2021, average housing prices were 12 times more than average incomes, data from Zhuge showed.
