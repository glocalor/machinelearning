In 2011, Louis Herron dropped out of Ball State University, packed a backpack and moved west.

Restless for outdoor adventure, the Indianapolis native picked up a job washing dishes at a restaurant near Yosemite National Park. He worked his way up to employee recreation, guiding hikes for park employees. After a couple of months, he nabbed a similar role at Glacier National Park before settling in Flagstaff, Arizona, right outside the Grand Canyon.

There, Herron spent $2,400 for an acre of land that would eventually host two tiny homes, his Grand Canyon touring business and his side hustle: a 16-foot yurt listed on Airbnb. In August 2020, Herron spent $15,000 to build the yurt and furnish it with amenities, including a compost toilet and water-pump sink, he says.

In the last year, Herron has made $27,600 through yurt rentals alone, according to documents reviewed by CNBC Make It. The yurt paid for itself within a year, he says.
